# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Common Development Commands

```bash
# Development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Development build (different Vite mode)
npm run build:dev

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Project Architecture

This is a React/TypeScript application built with Vite that implements a decentralized music platform with token-gated access control using TACo encryption.

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: React Context + TanStack React Query
- **Authentication**: Privy (wallet/email/Farcaster) + Supabase
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Storage**: IPFS via Lighthouse
- **Encryption**: NuCypher TACo for token-gated content access

### Key Architectural Patterns

**Dual Authentication System**:
- `AuthContext` manages Privy authentication and Supabase user state
- `WalletContext` handles wallet connections and network switching
- Progressive initialization ensures wallet is ready before user operations

**Encrypted Content Distribution**:
- All audio files encrypted with TACo before IPFS upload
- Decryption requires wallet signatures and token ownership verification
- Uses ERC20/ERC721 conditions for access control

**Network Strategy**:
- Authentication uses Ethereum mainnet
- TACo operations use Polygon Amoy testnet
- Separate providers handle each network context

**Data Model**:
- Users identified by wallet address (not traditional IDs)
- Minimal schema: `users` and `tracks` tables
- Tracks store IPFS CIDs and metadata only

### Key Components Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ contexts/           # Global state (Auth, Wallet)
â”œâ”€â”€ integrations/       # External services (Supabase, TACo)
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ audio/         # Audio playback components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth/          # Authentication UI
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ taco/          # TACo condition setup
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ upload/        # File upload handling
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ui/            # shadcn/ui components
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/             # Custom hooks for business logic
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/             # Utility functions (encryption, formatting)
â””â”€â”€ types/             # TypeScript type definitions
```

### Important Integration Notes

**TACo Initialization**: 
- Must complete before any encryption/decryption operations
- App continues gracefully if TACo init fails
- Network configuration is hardcoded for Polygon Amoy testnet

**Supabase Integration**:
- Auto-generated types from database schema
- Uses Row Level Security for user data protection
- Client configured with anon key and service role

**Audio Playback Flow**:
1. Fetch encrypted content from IPFS
2. Attempt TACo decryption with wallet signatures
3. Create blob URL from decrypted data
4. Load into HTML5 audio element

### Development Notes

- Configuration values (Privy App ID, Supabase URL) are hardcoded in source
- No test suite currently configured
- Uses address-based user identification throughout
- Graceful error handling for Web3 operations is critical

## Product Overview - SoundProof

# SoundProof â€“ Productâ€‘Only Overview

Welcome to **SoundProof**â€”a musicâ€‘discovery experience that pays 90 % of every sale directly to emerging artists and lets listeners permanently own the songs they love.

> This document is intentionally **nonâ€‘technical**. It describes *what* the product must achieve, not *how* to code it. An LLM engineer should turn each section into working software using any suitable technology.

---

## 1. Core Idea (One Line)

**Payâ€‘once** (â‰ˆ 3 Â¢) â†’ **own a track forever** â†’ **discover tomorrow's artists today**.

---

## 2. Key Personas & Daily Jobsâ€‘toâ€‘Beâ€‘Done

| Persona                          | Motivation                                                 | Dayâ€‘1 Success Moment                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Listener** ("Crateâ€‘Digger")    | Be first to find fresh underground music, keep it forever. | Purchases 5 tracks in first session without seeing a paywall popâ€‘up.            |
| **Creator** ("Bedroom Producer") | Upload quickly, earn real money, and watch fandom grow.    | Gets first payout notification within 24 hours of upload.                       |
| **Curator** ("Playlist DJ")      | Build reputation and income by sharing killer playlists.   | Earns first referral payout when a follower buys from their immutable playlist. |

## 3. Mustâ€‘Have User Flows

1. **Leanâ€‘back feed** (30â€‘sec hooks â†’ full track).
2. **Oneâ€‘click upload** (encrypt â†’ publish).
3. **Instant ownership** (hidden purchase, no wallet friction).
4. **Immutable playlist publish** (via Farcaster cast).
5. **Creator dashboard** (realâ€‘time sales + follower growth).
6. **Feed filters** ("Humans only", "Hide tracks I already own").

*If a feature does not serve one of these flows, it is optional.*

---

## 4. Product Rules & Constraints

* **Economics**  90 % artist 10 % treasury (for storage + ops).
* **Pricing**    TrackPass starts at 3 Â¢; bondingâ€‘curve step 0.025 % with 99 Â¢ cap.
* **Storage**    Free quota = 250 MB (â‰ˆ 2 albums); extra paid by creator.
* **Social graph**  Leverage Farcaster FIDs for follow/likeâ€”no duplicate tables.
* **Playlists**  Immutable casts; clones flagged + downâ€‘ranked.
* **Governance**  Dualâ€‘house (creators & listeners) with âˆšâ€‘weighted votes; timelock 48 h.

---

## 5. Launchâ€‘Phase Feature Checklist

* [ ] **Creativeâ€‘Commons seed import** (â‰¥ 2 k tracks).
* [ ] Friendsâ€‘andâ€‘DM private uploader (target +300 tracks).
* [ ] Public beta waitâ€‘list & open upload (target cumulative 3 kâ€“4 k tracks).
* [ ] Daily "Discovery Mix" (fresh tracks < 1 k plays).
* [ ] Firstâ€‘500â€‘sales artist spotlight push.
* [ ] Farcaster Frame player with buy button.
* [ ] Basic creator payout reporting (.csv download).

A public launch is *ready* when:
**â‰¥ 3 k tracks**, **avg. listener session â‰¥ 15 min**, **artists paid â‰¥ \$500 total.**

---

## 6. Postâ€‘Launch Growth Ideas (Optional)

* Live DJ rooms + mix recording ("Open Decks Friday").
* Remix bounties funded by listeners.
* Season Pass (subscription for N free TrackPass claims).
* Verifiedâ€‘human badge & AIâ€‘filter.
* DAOâ€‘funded grant program for indie labels.
